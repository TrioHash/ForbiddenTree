# Forbidden Tree Project (Generative Art)
The forbidden tree is a common motif found in many mythologies and religious traditions around the world. In many cases, it is portrayed as a tree whose fruit or knowledge is forbidden to humans or certain divine beings. In the Abrahamic tradition, the forbidden tree is the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil from which Adam and Eve were forbidden to eat in the Garden of Eden. Similarly, in Norse mythology, the goddess Idunn guarded a tree that bore golden apples that granted eternal youth, which was also forbidden to mortals. The motif of the forbidden tree often serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of disobedience or hubris, and highlights the tension between human curiosity and the limitations imposed by the divine or natural order.
